// -------------- CHANGELOG -------------------------
August 30th
1. Added all states to drop down with jquery
2. Fixed snow placement and added a parameter SNOWBANDWIDTH that controls how wide the band of snow is relative to the mountain width.
3. Introduced a bug: the first time a state is selected it gives the "empty list" alert, but then it never does after that.  I am confused by this, because by definition I only add states to the drop down that have some ski areas.

August 29th
1. Added header (Google says 44px is iPhone-standard header height)
2. Can select states now (no "all" option yet)
3. Use adjectives in dropdowns, but nouns on labels.
	- eg. "Snowiest ski resorts..." in the dropdown 
				"Most snowfall ... Least snowfall" in the labels

August 28th
1. Improved the ski area list.
2. Ski Area names are now the colloqial name, like "Squaw Valley" instead of "Squaw Valley Ski Resort"
3. Set the names to shift downwards by ~ windowheight/data.length
4. Didn't master the phonegap yet.

August 26th, Sebastian:
1. Removed huge snow to make snow begin to fall sooner ... :(
2. Put javascript files in /js/ and css+fonts in /style/
3. Put jQuery & D3 in libs.js
4. Offlined Google webfonts
5. Renamed files so landing page could be index.
6. Added sortby functionality

August 26th, Calder:
1. Commented out the console.log's in "DISPLAY SKI AREA INFO (on hover)" section of index.html
2. Compiled the jade files to html (this is required for phonegap) (Note: phonegap also requires the startup page to be index.html)
3. Made a list of ski areas, and a list of states... these are global variables saved in skiAreaList
4. Added helper functions for filtering skiAreaList by state.





// ----------------- TODO -----------------------
* put in formula A = triangle width/2, O = triangle height, angle to rotate is -atan(O/A) 
* Understand why computer seems to work harder and harder as time goes on.
* Hover-stats functionality (it's an excellent idea!)
* Come up with three names each for the app
	- And if possible, make the name something that could be used in .header-text (instead of "ski resorts in"). It would be cool if it played nicely with that, so it would kind of work as a functional title.
* Phonegap it.
* Make snowfall gaussian



// ----------------- DONE -----------------------
* Fix minor problem: when page first loads, Claifornia is displayed, but option:"California" is not selected.  This causes some problems.
* Maybe make the y-distance from mountain base to the black header correspond to 4500 ft. (That is slightly more than the most vertical of any mountain.)  As it stands, some mountains go off the top of the screen.
* Currently, snow only falls on the left half of the mountain.
* Maybe: Scale everything down. (At iPhone-like heights, mountain names end up below the viewport.)
* "Least Awesome is at right of window, should be at rght of doc or body or something... and what about that line?"
* Left side of left-most mountain is cut off.
* Fix snowfall drop x-coordinate. (Most evident on states like NV).
* (Maybe) populate states dropdown menu programmatically. If not, I just need to fill in each state that has ski areas by hand.
* Drop-down menu to select state (should this just be in a corner of the main page, or should it be on a separate landing page that explains the app and stuff?)
* Replace cdn scripts with minified files so that the app works 100% offline.
* Three names: "Rank my ski area" "Rank my mountain" "All Ski Resorts"... these names are boring but maybe likely to show up in app store searches.  I'm gonna keep thinking.
		Seb: One more idea. I'll keep thinking though
			- Ski ReSort (get it?)
