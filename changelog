// -------------- CHANGELOG -------------------------
August 26th, Sebastian:
1. Removed huge snow to make snow begin to fall sooner ... :(
2. Put javascript files in /js/ and css+fonts in /style/
3. Put jQuery & D3 in libs.js
4. Offlined Google webfonts
5. Renamed files so landing page could be index.
6. Added sortby functionality

August 26th, Calder:
1. Commented out the console.log's in "DISPLAY SKI AREA INFO (on hover)" section of index.html
2. Compiled the jade files to html (this is required for phonegap) (Note: phonegap also requires the startup page to be index.html)
3. Made a list of ski areas, and a list of states... these are global variables saved in skiAreaList
4. Added helper functions for filtering skiAreaList by state.





// ----------------- TODO -----------------------
* Hover-stats functionality (it's an excellent idea!)
* Drop-down menu to select state (should this just be in a corner of the main page, or should it be on a separate landing page that explains the app and stuff?)
* Come up with three names each for the app
* Phonegap it.
* Maybe: Scale everything down. (At iPhone-like heights, mountain names end up below the viewport.)



// ----------------- DONE -----------------------
* Replace cdn scripts with minified files so that the app works 100% offline?
