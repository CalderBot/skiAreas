// -------------- CHANGELOG -------------------------
August 28th
1. Improved the ski area list.
2. Ski Area names are now the colloqial name, like "Squaw Valley" instead of "Squaw Valley Ski Resort"
3. Set the names to shift downwards by ~ windowheight/data.length
4. Didn't master the phonegap yet.

August 26th, Sebastian:
1. Removed huge snow to make snow begin to fall sooner ... :(
2. Put javascript files in /js/ and css+fonts in /style/
3. Put jQuery & D3 in libs.js
4. Offlined Google webfonts
5. Renamed files so landing page could be index.
6. Added sortby functionality

August 26th, Calder:
1. Commented out the console.log's in "DISPLAY SKI AREA INFO (on hover)" section of index.html
2. Compiled the jade files to html (this is required for phonegap) (Note: phonegap also requires the startup page to be index.html)
3. Made a list of ski areas, and a list of states... these are global variables saved in skiAreaList
4. Added helper functions for filtering skiAreaList by state.





// ----------------- TODO -----------------------
* Hover-stats functionality (it's an excellent idea!)
* Drop-down menu to select state (should this just be in a corner of the main page, or should it be on a separate landing page that explains the app and stuff?)
* Come up with three names each for the app
* Phonegap it.
* Maybe: Scale everything down. (At iPhone-like heights, mountain names end up below the viewport.)



// ----------------- DONE -----------------------
* Replace cdn scripts with minified files so that the app works 100% offline.
* Three names: "Rank my ski area" "Rank my mountain" "All Ski Resorts"... these names are boring but maybe likely to show up in app store searches.  I'm gonna keep thinking.
